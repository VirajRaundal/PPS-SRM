# SRM-PPS-ELAB-All-Questions
<h1>Why did I do this?</h1>
I hate to do C programming and hence I solved all the questions and put them up here so that you won't have to reinvent the wheel always lol. 

<h1> How to use this?</h1>
Well, all the files have been written marked as LxCy where 'x' represents the Level number and 'y' represents the Challenge number.
To make navigating through the repo easier I have also put the respective code in the respective folder. For example, the challenges relating to Input Output have been put in the Input Output Folder. 

<h1> Enjoy and don't report me lol </h1>
