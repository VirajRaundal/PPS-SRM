# Abrevation 😏
<h1>Why did I do this?</h1>
So that you won't have to reinvent the wheel lol. 

<h1> How to use this?</h1>
Well, all the files have been written marked as LxCy where 'x' represents the Level number and 'y' represents the Challenge number.
To make navigating through the repo easier I have also put the respective code in the respective folder. For example, the challenges relating to Input Output have been put in the Input Output Folder. 

<h1> Enjoy and don't report me lol </h1>
PS: I don't really know how to use GitHub yet so this repo will probably look like shit. Bear with me 🥴.
